	SAT Competition 2022 is a competitive event for solvers of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem.
	It is organized as a satellite event to the 
	<a href="http://satisfiability.org/SAT22/">SAT Conference 2022</a>
	and stands in the tradition of the annual <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org">SAT Competitions and SAT-Races / Challenges</a>.
	
	<h3><a name="Objective">Objective</a></h3>
	<p>
	The area of SAT Solving has seen tremendous progress over the last years.
	Many problems (e.g. in hardware and software verification) that seemed to be completely out of reach a decade ago can now be handled routinely.
	Besides new algorithms and better heuristics, refined implementation techniques turned out to be vital for this success.
	</p>
	<p>
	To keep up the driving force in improving SAT solvers, we want to motivate implementers to present their work to a broader audience and to compare it with that of others.
	</p>
	<p>
	Researchers from both academia and industry are invited to submit their solvers and benchmarks to SAT Competition 2022.
	</p>

<li>2022-08-18, We have a new winner to announce in this competition: The winner of the Cadical Hack track is Norbert Manthey with his solver <b>Cadical-watchsat-lto</b>. The reason for this late announcement is that many Cadical hacks have not been announced in the submission emails but only in the solver descriptions. In the future, we will provide clearer instructions on what has to be announced in the submission email.</li>
