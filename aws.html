	<h2>Parallel and Cloud Track Submissions</h2>

The Parallel and Cloud tracks will be run on Amazon Web Services. 
Participants of these tracks are required to submit their solver via
a GitHub repository (which can be private). The repository should contain
a docker file that compiles the solver. Scripts for account configuration
and instructions to construct a solver in the default configuration are available at:
<a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-comp-infrastructure-sample">
https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-comp-infrastructure-sample</a>.
We also provide an example repository that builds a Docker image with the mallob-mono
solver that runs on the sat comp infrastructure here:
<a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-satcomp-solver-sample">
https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-satcomp-solver-sample</a>.
